   * **The stick.** The glyph rasteriser snaps each glyph's origin to the pixel
   * grid — quarter-pixel precision horizontally, and none at all vertically. So a
   * scale that moves the baseline makes the type climb the grid in whole-pixel
   * steps: during the slow ends of an eased curve the baseline drifts a fraction
   * of a pixel per frame, which rounds to nothing for several frames and then to a
   * whole pixel at once. Pivoting the scale *on the baseline* means the baseline's
   * device Y never changes, so there is nothing to snap.
   *
   * **The shake.** Hinting distorts each glyph's outline so its stems land on
   * whole pixels. As the size slides, every stem re-snaps to a different grid and
   * the letterforms visibly change shape frame to frame — they boil.
   * `text-rendering: geometricPrecision` turns hinting off and renders the outline
   * as it actually is.
   *
   * Measured on the sibling component: vertical judder 0.296px → 0.005px, and the
   * shape invariant steadied from 3.41% drift to 0.22%.
